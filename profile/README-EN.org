*Cyber Code Syndicate (CCS)* is a collaborative learning and development community that promotes *ethical software practices*, with a primary focus on *Spanish-speaking developers*. We teach how to *code, document, and build* useful projects by combining *hands-on education*, *mentorship*, and *open development* /(Free and Open Source)/. We promote *autonomy*, *privacy*, and *transparency*, and welcome anyone interested — from beginners to experienced professionals — to participate, contribute, and apply *ethical principles* in software environments that are *free*, *mixed*, or *proprietary*.

#+END_QUOTE

* Guiding principles for software development (summary)
These principles guide how we *design, build, and evaluate software* within *CCS*. They are not *mandatory rules*, but *practical criteria* for creating *responsible, people-centered technology*. For a more detailed and contextual explanation, see the [[#further-reading][Community Paper]].

- Software must *serve people*, never exploit them.
- *Privacy by default* and responsible *data minimization*.
- *Transparency* and *auditability* of both code and technical decisions.
- *Freedom* to use, study, modify, and share software.
- *Interoperability* and rejection of *technological lock-in* or forced dependencies.
- *Ethics* act as *practical guidance*, not enforcement; we *lead by example*.

* Mission
To give *practical form* to these *principles* by making technical learning and *ethical software development* both *accessible and applicable*. *CCS* focuses on providing *resources in Spanish*, *learning spaces*, and *community-driven projects* that enable people to *learn by doing*, *collaborate openly*, and *make informed decisions* when building software.

* What we do
To fulfill this *mission*, the *community*:
- *Translates* and *contextualizes* relevant guides and *technical documentation*.
- *Organizes* talks, workshops, and *mentorship sessions* with a practical focus.
- *Develops* and *maintains* *open projects* oriented toward *collaborative learning*.
- *Publishes* articles and *educational materials* in Spanish.
- *Promotes* *interoperability* and *freedom of technological choice*.
- *Supports* *Free Software* and *Open Source* projects through *community collaboration*.

* How to participate
*CCS* is an *open and flexible community*. You can:
- *Start* by reading the [[#further-reading][Community Paper]] and the *code of conduct*.
- *Explore* the available projects.
- *Propose* ideas, *open issues*, offer *reviews*, or suggest *workshop topics*.
- *Join* events or *request mentorship* if you are looking for *practical guidance*.

* Goals
1. *Expand* access to *high-quality materials* in Spanish.
2. *Offer* a *sustainable and replicable mentorship program*.
3. *Develop* *educational projects* that serve as *practical references*.
4. *Facilitate* the *responsible adoption* of software in *mixed contexts* /(open/proprietary)/.

* Governance and licensing
- *CCS* is an *open and collaborative community*. *Decisions* are *public* and recorded in *repositories and forums*.
- *Content* and *projects* may be released under *different licenses* depending on the author or project. We *recommend* licenses that promote *transparency* and *reuse*, while always respecting *contributors’ freedom of choice*.

* Further reading
Here you will find detailed information about the community’s *approach*, *mission*, and *principles*, as well as the conceptual framework that guides how we *build and collaborate* on software:

* Closing / Invitation
*Cyber Code Syndicate* is an *open space* to *learn*, *build*, and *improve software* in a *conscious and responsible* way. If you are interested in *learning by doing*, *sharing knowledge*, *collaborating with others*, and *developing software* that respects the people who use it, you are *welcome to participate*.

Regardless of your *experience level* or the *tools* you use, you can *learn*, *propose ideas*, *contribute to projects*, *improve documentation*, or simply *take part in the conversation*. *CCS* exists to *support the technical and ethical growth* of those who build technology.
